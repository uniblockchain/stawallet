## Introduction
Stawallet is a service to simplify the deposit and withdraw of cryptocurrency assets...

## Getting started
1. Make 2 coins seed and backup from `BIP-0039` mnemonic words (Don't skip the backup section, or you will loose anything).
2. Start blockchain rpc-enabled daemon of all supported cryptocurrencies (docker is great for it).
3. For each cryptocurrency, choose an address as the base address in your cold coins.
4. For each cryptocurrency, make `XPRV` derivation using `m/44'/coin_type'/account_index'/` as path (`account_index` could be anything, choose `0` for beginning)
5. Configure the `application.conf` by obtained addresses and keys.
6. Configure the `application.conf` by the rpc server IPs and Ports.
7. Start Stawallet and enjoy it. Take care!
